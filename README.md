# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room, the client, requested a web-based expansion of their Android game called "Draw it or Lose it." Their main requirements were to create a multiplayer game that renders drawing clues from a stock image library, supports multiple teams, enforces unique game and player names, uses a singleton pattern to ensure only one game instance exists in memory, and implements strict timing rules for each round of play.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I clearly outlined the client’s needs and translated them into specific, actionable software requirements. I also incorporated strong object-oriented design principles, like encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction, into the domain model, making the structure logical and scalable.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Creating a thorough design document helped by providing a clear blueprint before coding began. It made it easier to identify key classes, relationships, and behaviors early on, reducing confusion later. It also helped ensure that the final product aligned closely with the client’s expectations.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the System Architecture View section. It was left mostly blank, but a detailed system topology or diagram showing the interaction between server, client, and database would have made the overall architecture clearer and more professional. I would add a visual diagram and a brief written description of data flow and component interaction.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on accessibility, multiplayer functionality, and ensuring game uniqueness through the singleton pattern. Considering user needs is critical because a software solution must not only function correctly but also provide a smooth, engaging, and intuitive user experience. Meeting user expectations is what ultimately determines a project's success.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached the design by breaking down the client's goals into specific system requirements and modeling the data using object-oriented principles. In the future, I would continue to use detailed requirement analysis, UML diagrams, and early prototyping. I would also conduct more stakeholder reviews during the design phase to validate that my understanding matches the client’s vision before moving to development.
